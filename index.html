        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I am a dedicated and passionate Computer Science undergraduate currently in my 5th semester with a CGPA 
            of 9.66. This capstone project marks my first step into applying classroom knowledge to real-world 
            software development. Through this project, I aimed to explore practical problem-solving using core CS 
            fundamentals, team collaboration, and hands-on coding. It reflects my growing skills in backend 
            development, algorithms, and software engineering practices, and lays the foundation for more advanced 
            future contributions.
